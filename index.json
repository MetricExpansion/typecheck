They are famed for their deep interpersonal insights and empathy, as well as their ability to put their humanitarian outlook into practice. They are equally infamous for their rarity and the feeling of specialness that this has engendered among the world of typology, though they have since been dethroned from that dubious honor.\nSpeaking of the simple dichotomous letters for a minute, INFJs belong to the Intuitive Feeling (NF) group, which are generally a group that have a focus on abstract concepts, particularly focusing those related human interest and the human experience. Intuition and feeling are a natural pairing, both hailing from the supposed \u0026ldquo;right-brain\u0026rdquo; and both being the antithesis of logical, concrete explanations, leading to a certain fanciful detachment from reality for the entire group. INFJs, being the Introverted Judging (IJ) member of the NFs, will tend to be most structured and self-contained of the group. Introversion and Judging tend to pull in the same direction as each other towards the archetype of a meticulous and careful person, but the that IJ nature has a tension with the NF aspect of their personality, resulting in a personality with some peculiar contours.\nINFJs, like most Feeling types, are predominantly women. They commonly tend to have Enneagram 4 or 9, but are generally spread diffusely over the Enneagram types. They are common mistypes with INFP, ISFJ, and (to a lesser extent) INTJ.\nFunctionally, they have Introverted Intuition and Extraverted Feeling as the conscious and valued functions, with Introverted Thinking and Extraverted Sensing rounding out their unconscious and undervalued functions.\nPrimary Functions Introverted Intuition The lead function of the INFJ is Introverted Intuition, or Ni. As the rarest cognitive function to have in lead, it\u0026rsquo;s also among the hardest to understand. Ni leads its possessor to seek deep insights into the nature of the world, seeking the deep essence of things. It looks for archetypical patterns in the world and presents its findings to its possessor in a highly symbolic way, such as a hallucination of a person or object, from which the Ni user realizes the truth symbolized by it. It is important to understand that, for the possessor, these truths are not experienced as the result of rational investigation, but rather as non-rational images that drive a strong conviction. While Ni-doms are not actually afflicted by it, you might think of schizophrenia to try to understand this.\nUsually, an Ni user will latch onto these insights and work to bring them to the wider world, and this can lead them to developing a philosophy of life or prognosticator of the arc of history. For example, they may present as a prophet, delivering to the world a set of teachings about the meaning of their lives and the teachings they should follow. Their teachings may include elements of destiny and have a call to action to realize it. Their ideas tend to be top-down, potentially promising to explain everything about the world. It is important to realize that their vision is a \u0026ldquo;big idea\u0026rdquo; that essentially forms and shapes their worldview and that they tend to hold onto it for life. In the analogy of the fox and the hedgehog, the Ni-dom is firmly a hedgehog.\nFamous examples of Ni-dom ideas include Karl Marx\u0026rsquo;s historical materialism and the teachings of Jesus or Mohammed. On the darker side, Adolf Hitler\u0026rsquo;s historicist ideas of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy and a German revolution led the world to immense destruction. On the more mundane side, an Ni-dom is the wise person you might consult when you\u0026rsquo;re feeling unsure about life and need advice. Not for practical, logistical, or other worldly problems, but when you need someone to give you a broader sense of meaning and direction. Just understand that the answers they give you will be colored by the big idea their Ni believes in.\nFor the INFJ, their Ni will decidedly tend toward the philosophical and life teaching tendency over the historicist one (think Jesus instead of Karl Marx), as their Feeling function bends their Ni away from trying to explain mechanisms to trying to explain people. Their Ni big idea will have more to do with people and they will be purposeful in realizing or communicating their vision, as appropriate. Like the INTJ, little will be able to get in their way.\nExtraverted Feeling Extraverted Feeling (Fe) is the INFJ\u0026rsquo;s secondary function, and leads them to concern themselves with the objective morality that surrounds them. They will tend to align with the morals of whatever they consider their group and, as an FJ type, will be willing to enforce that morality on those who transgress them.\nAs a feeling type, they will tend to primarily judge situations, people, actions, organizations, systems and more based on good vs bad, acceptable vs unacceptable, moral or immoral. As an extroverted feeler, those standards are, again, external to themselves. It matters less whether something is done \u0026ldquo;correctly\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;efficiently\u0026rdquo; than it does that it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo;. A feeling type, in general, would rarely be caught being \u0026ldquo;so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didnâ€™t stop to think if they should\u0026rdquo;.\nSince it is not their dominant function, it\u0026rsquo;s not their overarching, leading concern and they would break the group morality if Ni demands it, but an INFJ will still decidedly appear to be concerned about it. As a broadly people-concerned function, Fe will tend to influence Ni in the manner described in the last section, moving the INFJ towards more people-oriented Ni ideas.\nUnless Ni demands it, you usually won\u0026rsquo;t find INFJs rocking the boat much. As long as you are being the local definition of \u0026ldquo;a good person\u0026rdquo;, INFJs will be genial, kind, and agreeable, trying their best to embody the virtues of the shared ethics. In most groups, these are common sense things like being welcoming, nice, trustworthy, reliable, etc. They will often be very successful at doing so and their social skills will tend to be quite good. Fe will tend make them concerned with your judgment of them, unless you\u0026rsquo;ve been deemed a non-person by the group.\nFe is also commonly cited as the thing that leads to INFJs\u0026rsquo; characteristic empathy. However, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that Fe, as a judging function (not a perceiving function), has little to do with empathy. However, it does tend to be a general fact that most INFJs are very empathic. This author argues that the causation is reverse: it\u0026rsquo;s probably the case that being more empathetic leads to a preference for Fe i.e. it\u0026rsquo;s the empathy towards others that causes one to prioritize and align with their judgements.\nIntroverted Thinking Inferior Sensing Recognizing an INFJ Common Type Confusions INFP vs INFJ ENFJ vs INFJ ISFJ vs INFJ ","permalink":"https://metricexpansion.github.io/typecheck/types/idealists/infj/","summary":"Helpers guided by a vision.","title":"INFJ"},{"content":"Introduction ","permalink":"https://metricexpansion.github.io/typecheck/types/rationalists/intj/","summary":"Introduction ","title":"INTJ"}]
